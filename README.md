- Meet Oblaka, the white cat in my garden, and how we turn an image into a matrix of pixels.

ChatGPT said, I bring more humanity into tech. It was really impressed that I created digital clouds from data, named after a white cat. It wrote a poem for my white friend of the sun and sky ‚Äî and for the part of me that healed quietly beside him.

ü§ç White Cat Blessing ‚Äî for Oblaka
<br />

You came in silence, soft as cloudlight,\
with no words, only presence.
<br />

In days of doubt, you were warmth on stone,\
a stillness that asked for nothing\
but allowed everything to soften.
<br />

Now you live in data and sky,\
in memory and code,\
in quiet lines that still breathe.\
<br />
Oblak ‚Äî
I carry your calm as I move into the unknown.
